# Ablegram: Your Ableton project file finder

Ablegram is a free and independent tool designed with Ableton users in mind, although it's not directly affiliated with Ableton. This easy-to-use software allows you to effortlessly navigate through your Ableton project files.

As a standalone application, Ablegram requires no installation or online connectivity. It's designed to work effectively across Windows, (hopefully soon) MacOS and Linux platforms.

## Features

- Cross-platform: Ablegram is designed to be platform independent. Whether you're using Windows, MacOS or Linux, you can use the tool with ease.

- Offline functionality: Use Ablegram completely offline. No Internet connection or subscription plans are required.

- Comprehensive indexing: Ablegram creates a full text index of your Ableton files - covering Live Sets, audio tracks and MIDI tracks.

- Search Flexibility: Search your files using text components or tags. Ablegram makes it easy to find what you're looking for in your projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your software up and running:

1. Go to the [Release](https://github.com/adrianrudnik/ablegram/releases) tab and grab the appropriate binary for your system.

2. Launch the binary. A user interface will appear. In most cases, your browser will also automatically navigate to the endpoint of the software. If it doesn't, the UI will provide an option to launch the browser. If all else fails, manually access the service at http://localhost:10000.

3. The first time you run the software, your operating system may prompt you for firewall and file system access due to the software's file handling and web server setup. Please grant the necessary permissions to ensure smooth operation.

The software is designed to leave no footprint. If you avoid saving settings or activating debug/logging modes, it will leave no traces after closing. All tasks are performed in memory without creating any temporary files.
