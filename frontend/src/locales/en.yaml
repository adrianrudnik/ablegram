# See https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/pluralization for pluralization
# An example how this is done in here:
#
# audio-track:
#   s: Audio track
#   c: Audio tracks | Audio track | Audio tracks
#   nc: No audio tracks | 1 audio track | {count} audio tracks
#
# The order is NONE | SINGLE | MULTIPLE
#
# "s" is the singular term
# "c" is the counted term, but without the counter, like "Cars" instead of "3 Cars".
# "nc" is the counted and numbered term, like "3 Cars" instead of "Cars".
#
# Values beginning with "'@:" are references to other values in this file.

tag-overview:
  explain:
    title: Tags explained
    description: >-
      As the files are processed, tags are derived from the content and information found.
      They help to create meaningful search queries. Tags are made up of several components.
      The following example describes each component:
    about: >-
      The categories below provide an insight into the tags identified.
      These are available in the search to formulate search queries.

  type:
    title: Type category
    description: >-
      Types group the information found according to its nature. They do not describe files,
      but the components of a single file.
  software:
    title: Software category
    description: >-
      This is the software that was used to create the file. The version numbers found are broken
      down into exact hits or individual Semver variants.
  location:
    title: Location category
    description: >-
      Contains tags that are related to the location of the
      file within the scanned drives and folders.
  file:
    title: File category
    description: >-
      These tags have been extracted from the processed files. They give an overview of what we know
      about the file itself and how we might classify it.
  live-set:
    title: Live Set category
    description: >-
      Although Live Sets are very similar to a single file, they give us different data.
      We learn more about the actual settings.
  info:
    title: Information category
    description: >-
      This category collects information that is not directly related to the other categories.
      It tries to give more insight into small details that can be found throughout the files.
  color:
    title: Color category
    description: >-
      The software allows visual labelling using colours.
      This category collects this information and makes it available for searching.

    title: Basics
    rules:
      description: >-
        The input field is a combination of automatic tag completion (via AutoComplete)
        and manual input. Here are some rules of conduct:
      list:
        1: >-
          If tags are to be used for the search, they must be entered first. The
          combination {0} is not possible via the AutoComplete function.
        2:
          text: >-
            The selection of several tags and possibly a free text is interpreted as a wish to
            find everything, in the sense of {e1}, not {e2}. The selection of a single tag or word
            is interpreted as a {e2}.
          should: should # e1
          must: must # e2
        3: >-
          The free texts are sorted by accuracy. The closer an entry is to the formulated text,
          the higher the search result is displayed.
      example:
        intro: >-
          Here is a simple example of a combined search and how the search engine understands it:
        explain:
          text: >-
            {e1} searches all results that contain {e2}, {e3} or
            the word {e4}. The more combinations found, the higher the search result. So the example
            project {e5} with a {e2} could be the first result.

    advanced:
      title: Advanced
      examples:
        description: >-
          Advanced search is possible via simple binary entries. Here are some examples to give ideas:
        list:
          1: >-
            {e1} searches only for audio tracks, regardless of whether additional
            search parameters have been specified. Other types are also {e2} and {e3}.
          2: >-
            {0} searches for all hits that are not MIDI tracks.
          3: >-
            {0} (watch the signs!) prefers MIDI tracks that must contain the word "fx".
          4: >-
            {0} searches for all data points that have the attribute BPM and whose
            value lies between 110 and 120.
          5: >-
            {0} searches for all data points associated
            with this exact filename.
          6: >-
            {e1} will exclude all results related to this folder. The same goes for the
            absolute path of a file with {e2}.
          7: >-
            {e1} without any further information searches all manual info field entries
            (like the Ableton Info-Text) for the word {e2}, which includes e.g. the word {e3}.
