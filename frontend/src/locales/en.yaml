# See https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/pluralization for pluralization
# An example how this is done in here:
#
# audio-track:
#   s: Audio track
#   c: Audio tracks | Audio track | Audio tracks
#   nc: No audio tracks | 1 audio track | {count} audio tracks
#
# The order is NONE | SINGLE | MULTIPLE
#
# "s" is the singular term
# "c" is the counted term, but without the counter, like "Cars" instead of "3 Cars".
# "nc" is the counted and numbered term, like "3 Cars" instead of "Cars".
#
# Values beginning with "'@:" are references to other values in this file.

        Advanced search is possible via simple binary entries. Here are some examples to give ideas:
      list:
        1: >-
          {e1} searches only for audio tracks, regardless of whether additional
          search parameters have been specified. Other types are also {e2} and {e3}.
        2: >-
          {0} searches for all hits that are not MIDI tracks.
        3: >-
          {0} (watch the signs!) prefers MIDI tracks that must contain the word "fx".
        4: >-
          {0} searches for all data points that have the attribute BPM and whose
          value lies between 110 and 120.
        5: >-
          {0} searches for all data points associated
          with this exact filename.
        6: >-
          {e1} will exclude all results related to this folder. The same goes for the
          absolute path of a file with {e2}.
        7: >-
          {e1} without any further information searches all manual info field entries
          (like the Ableton Info-Text) for the word {e2}, which includes e.g. the word {e3}.
        8: >-
          Wildcard works as well: {e1} search for all data. {e2} searches for all annotations with any
          value (but should be present).
