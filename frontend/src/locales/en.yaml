# See https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/pluralization for pluralization
# An example how this is done in here:
#
# audio-track:
#   s: Audio track
#   c: Audio tracks | Audio track | Audio tracks
#   nc: No audio tracks | 1 audio track | {count} audio tracks
#
# The order is NONE | SINGLE | MULTIPLE
#
# "s" is the singular term
# "c" is the counted term, but without the counter, like "Cars" instead of "3 Cars".
# "nc" is the counted and numbered term, like "3 Cars" instead of "Cars".
#
# Values beginning with "'@:" are references to other values in this file.
