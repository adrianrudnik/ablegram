The search page consists of two main parts: the search bar and the search results. The search bar is always visible at the top of the page, while the search results are displayed below it.

## Search bar

The search bar consists of a field where you can enter search queries.

-- SCREEN

Here you can enter any search query. The search query is a combination of search terms and filters. The search terms are the words that you enter into the search bar. The filters are the parts of the search query that start with a `+` sign.
