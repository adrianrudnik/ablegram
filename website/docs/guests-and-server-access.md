# Guest access to the server

The Ablegram service provides the search frontend as a web-based application.

This allows you and anyone else on the same LAN to access the search frontend using a web browser.

## Restrictions

As security is an important concern, the service is offered with the following restrictions:

- Visitors who open the search frontend via the shared URL will be identified as guests.
- Visitors arriving via the automatically opened browser window will be identified as admin.
- Visitors arriving via the "Open Search" button in the GUI will be identified as admin.
- Guests will not be able to change any settings.
- Guests will not be able to download files.
- Guests will not be able to perform any modifications or intrusive operations such as opening files and folders.

## Advantages

After all these restrictions, here is what the Guest service offers:

- Guests can search and browse the library for you.
- Guests can suggest a search result item to admins.
- Guests can become admins using the [Master Password](./service-arguments#master-password-password) set by the admin.

Other benefits will be added in the future as they are implemented and make sense in LAN or even WAN environments.
