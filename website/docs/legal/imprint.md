## Liability for content

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with Section 7 (1) TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general legislation.
According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this.
However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement.
If we become aware of any such legal infringements, we will remove the content immediately.

Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for this third-party content.
The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking.
