# Privacy policy

The person responsible within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation and other similar laws is me:

Adrian Rudnik  
Schwalbenstr. 5 A  
68309 Mannheim

E-mail: [info@ablegram.app](mailto:info@ablegram.app)

## Rights of the data subjects

###  Right to information

You have the right to request confirmation from me as to whether I am processing personal data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to information about this data and to the information listed in Art. 15 GDPR.

### Right to rectification

In accordance with Art. 16 GDPR, you have the right to obtain from me without undue delay the rectification or completion of inaccurate personal data

### Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to demand that I restrict processing if one of the conditions described in Art. 18 GDPR is met.

### Right to erasure

You have the right to demand that I erase your data immediately if one of the reasons listed in Art. 17 GDPR applies or if I no longer need the data for the purposes pursued.

### Right to information

If you have exercised a right under points 2, 3 and 4, I am obliged to provide all recipients with this information as long as I am able to do so and it does not involve disproportionate effort.

### Right to portability

You have the right to receive your data in a commonly used, machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit this data to another controller, provided that the processing is based on consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR), a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) and this data is processed by automated means.

### Right to object

You can object to the processing if this is done on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR.

I will then no longer process the personal data unless there are compelling legitimate grounds that I can prove outweigh your concerns. Another exception that allows me to continue processing this data is if I have to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

If the personal data is used for direct advertising, you can object to this at any time, both to the advertising and to the processing for this purpose.

### Right to withdraw consent

You have the right to withdraw your consent to this privacy policy at any time. The revocation becomes effective on the date on which it is received by us and does not affect the previous consent up to that date.

### Rights in the case of automated decisions

You have the right to an individual decision from me if you see a disadvantage resulting from automated profiling. This does not apply if it is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract, violates legal regulations or is carried out with your express consent.

### Right to lodge a complaint

If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR (see Art. 77 GDPR), you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You can assert this right with supervisory authorities within the EU, as long as it concerns the place of residence, the workplace or the place of the infringement.
