# Live Demo

A working read-only demo of a selection of Ableton projects is available online.

You can access this demo at [https://demo.ablegram.app/](https://demo.ablegram.app/).

The demo itself is not a special build of Ablegram, but the same version available for download.

It runs in an isolated container containing some sample project files. It is started with the following arguments

```bash
ablegram -demo-mode -no-gui -no-browser -log-level debug
```
